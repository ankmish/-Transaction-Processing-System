# Transaction-Processing-System

Design a Transaction Processing System

You are tasked with designing a transaction processing system. The system should handle transactions involving different types of financial operations such as deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and balance inquiries. The system should be scalable, reliable, and maintainable.

## Requirements:

1. Implement a class or set of classes that represent the core components of the transaction processing system.
2. The system should support different types of accounts (e.g., savings, checking).
3. Each transaction should have a timestamp, transaction type, and relevant account information.
4. Implement methods to process transactions like deposits, withdrawals, and transfers between accounts.
5. Ensure that the system can handle concurrent transactions without data inconsistencies or race conditions.
6. Implement a method to retrieve the balance for a given account at a specific point in time.
7. Design the system in a way that makes it easy to extend with new transaction types in the future.

## Guidelines:

1. You can use any programming language of your choice.
2. Focus on code modularity, readability, and maintainability.
3. Use appropriate data structures and algorithms to handle concurrent transactions efficiently.
4. Provide clear comments and documentation for your code.
5. You can assume that the underlying data storage (e.g., database) is already provided and you only need to implement the transaction processing logic.
6. Handle any potential errors or exceptions gracefully and provide meaningful error responses for invalid requests or exceptional scenarios.
7. Having test cases is a bonus if time allows.
